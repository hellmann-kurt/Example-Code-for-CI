# Example-Code-for-Conservation International
These Python code excerpts are from my 2015 research at the University of Nevada Reno, where my objectives were to read hydrologic data from a CE-QUAL-W2 model and to make a 2D animation of the output. The larger of goal of this research was to locate optimal re-introduction habitat for Salmon based on water velocity and water temperature at various depths and lengths along the McCloud and Sacramento Rivers. 

The mp4 file is a "movie" of animated hydrologic output from each day for an entire hydrologic year for the McCloud River.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for connecting with me earlier today and for sharing more about the position. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,
Kurt
